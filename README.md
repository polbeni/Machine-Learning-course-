# Machine-Learning-course-

This is my first GitHub repository!

I am studying a machine learning course at **[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)** called _Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science_, by Hadelin de Ponteves and SuperDataScience Team.

I like to code and almost everything that I have coded is scientific or basic computer science problems. This is my first incursion in data science (or at least 'pure' data science field) field and in concrete in Machine learning field, and I am very excited because is a topic that fascinate me since 2 or 3 years ago.

In this repository I want to upload all the notes that I take and the problems that I solve from the course.
Here will not be something completely original or some personal project, this is left for a future repository, when my data science skills will may be better.
